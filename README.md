# dhcp_lease

The goal of this project is collect dhcp data from Mikrotik routers.

This data can be useful to monitor networks, mainly open wifi networks.

To use it, you will need a Mikrotik router with API enable and the user and password.

These scripts should be adapted, but you can use it with a single database table to store all data.
